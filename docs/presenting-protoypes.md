# Presenting and Sharing Prototypes

## Publishing the Prototype

1. **Click the Share button** in the top-right corner of the Figma interface.
2. **Set the sharing permissions** by choosing one of these options:

      <div style="border: 2px solid #0066cc; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
      <strong>Sharing Options Explained:</strong>

   **Anyone with the link:**

   - Anyone who has the URL can access the prototype
   - No sign-in required
   - Best for: Public projects, client presentations, wide distribution

   **Specific individuals or teams:**

   - Only invited people can access
   - Requires Figma account sign-in
   - Best for: Internal projects, confidential designs, work in progress
   - Privacy consideration: More secure, can track viewers and manage permissions
   - Additional controls: - Can set view-only or edit permissions - Can revoke access at any time - Can disable download/copy options
