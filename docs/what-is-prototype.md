# What is a Protoype?

## Why use Protoypes?

Figma‚Äôs prototyping features allow you to create interactive flows that explore how a user may interact with your designs.

Prototypes are a fantastic way to:

- Preview interactions and user flows.
- Share and iterate on ideas.
- Get feedback from collaborators.
- Test interactions with users.
- Present your designs to stakeholders.

## What is a User Flow?

With prototyping in Figma, you can create multiple user flows for your prototype in one page to preview a user's full journey and experience through your designs. Imagine you're designing an app or a website, and you want to show how a user moves from one screen to another. A Figma flow creates a map of the users journey, and demonstrates how the different screens (or frames) are connected. When you click a button, a link, or swipe, it takes you to the next step in the journey.

For example:
üì± Home Screen ‚Üí Tap ‚ÄúShop Now‚Äù ‚Üí üõçÔ∏è Products Page ‚Üí Select an item ‚Üí üõí Cart Page

Each of these steps is part of a flow, showing how users navigate through your app or website. It helps designers test ideas before writing any code, making sure everything works smoothly!

## Flow Starting Points

Figma creates a flow starting point when you add your first connection between two frames. There are a few other ways to add a flow starting point to your prototype:

- With the starting frame selected, click **+** in the **Flow starting point** section of the right sidebar.
- **Right-click** on the frame, then click **Add starting point**.
- Duplicate a frame with an existing starting point.

When it's time to test your designs, you can share the entire prototype or copy the link to a flow starting point.

**Note:**
In Figma, a top-level frame is like the main page of your app or website. This main page can be part of different flows, but it can only have one starting point. However, inside this main page, you can have buttons or links that lead to different experiences.

For example:
A Log In and Sign Up button can both be inside the same starting screen. Clicking Log In will take the user to the start of one flow, while clicking Sign Up will take them to the start of a different flow. Even though they start in the same place, they lead to different journeys!

Frames nested within a top-level starting frame can have connections that navigate the user around multiple flows.

## Create Connections

1. Select the hotspot for the connection.
2. Click **+** to create the connection.
3. Drag it to the destination.
4. If there are no existing connections, Figma will make the first frame a starting point.

<div style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 236, 28); padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
<strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Tip: </strong> You can create connections from multiple objects to the same destination frame at the same time‚Äîsaving you time and effort when building out your prototype flows. </div>

To do so:

- Select multiple starting hotspots on your canvas.
- Click and drag the **+** icon to the destination.

## Create Interactions and Animations

1. Open the **Prototype** tab in the right sidebar.
2. Add interactions.
3. Set interaction details.
4. Apply an animation.
5. Preview your animation.

## Adjust Prototype Settings

1. Select a **Device and Model**.
2. Preview your prototype.
3. Select **Background color**.
4. Set the prototype's **Starting Frame**.

## Publishing the Prototype

1. **Click the Share button** in the top-right corner of the Figma interface.
2. **Set the sharing permissions** to either **Anyone with the link** or specify particular individuals or teams.
3. **Click Copy Link** to obtain the URL for sharing your prototype.

---

## Presenting the Prototype

1. **Open the prototype link** in your browser by pasting the copied link.
2. **Enter Presentation Mode** by clicking on the full-screen icon, which will display your design in a distraction-free environment.
3. Navigate through frames and interactions to demonstrate the flow.
