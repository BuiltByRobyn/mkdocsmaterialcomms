# Presenting and Sharing Prototypes

---

## Publishing the Prototype

1. Click the blue Share button in the top-right corner of the Figma interface.

2. Set the sharing permissions by choosing the appropriate visibility.

---

## Sharing Options Explained:

### Anyone with the link:

- Anyone who has the URL can access the prototype.
- No sign-in is required to view the design.
- Best for: Public projects and client presentations.
- Privacy consideration: Less secure, as owner cannot track who has viewed the prototype.

### Specific individuals or teams:

- Only people who have received an invitation can access the design.
- Requires viewers to have a Figma account, and to have signed-in to their profile.
- Best for: Confidential designs and work that is still in progress.
- Privacy consideration: More secure, owner of the file can track viewers and manage permissions easily.

### Additional controls:

In addition to adjusting visibility settings for the file, the owner of the project can also:

- Set specific view-only or edit permissions.
- Revoke access for a user at any time.
- Disable the option to download or copy the file.

## Copy and Share the Link:

Click **Share** -> **Copy Link** to obtain the URL for sharing your prototype.

## Presentation Options Explained:

### Preview Button:

Displays the prototype directly within the editor, allowing you to test functionality and make adjustments without switching tabs. Ideal for quick iterations during development.

### Present Button:

Opens the prototype in a separate tab for full-screen viewing. Useful for sharing with others, testing on different devices, or showcasing the design in a presentation setting. Allows navigatation through frames and interactions, which is useful to demonstrate user flow.
