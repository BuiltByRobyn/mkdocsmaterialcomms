# Good Design Practice

Using grids in Figma helps maintain consistency and alignment in your designs. Here's how to implement and use grids effectively:

## Adding a Grid

1. **Select the Frame**:

   - Click on the frame or canvas where you want to add a grid.

2. **Enable Grid**:

   - Go to the **Design** tab in the right sidebar.
   - Under the **Layout Grid** section, click the **+** button to add a grid.

3. **Customize the Grid**:
   - Choose between **Grid**, **Columns**, or **Rows**.
   - Adjust the grid size, color, and opacity to suit your design needs.

## Types of Layout Grids

Figma supports three types of layout grids:

### Grid

- A uniform grid with equally spaced horizontal and vertical lines.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for aligning elements in a structured manner.
- **Customization**:

  - **Size**: Set the spacing between grid lines.
  - **Color**: Choose a color for the grid lines.
  - **Opacity**: Adjust the visibility of the grid lines.

### Columns

- A vertical grid system with customizable column widths and gutters.
- **Use Case**: Perfect for creating responsive layouts for web or mobile designs.
- **Customization**:
  - **Count**: Set the number of columns.
  - **Gutter**: Define the spacing between columns.
  - **Margin**: Set the spacing around the edges of the frame.

### Rows

- A horizontal grid system with customizable row heights and gutters.
- **Use Case**: Useful for aligning content vertically, such as in tables or lists.
- **Customization**:
  As seen with columns:
- **Count**: Set the number of rows.
- Gutter: Define the spacing between rows.
- Margin: Set the spacing around the edges of the frame.

### Best Practices for Using Grids

- **Consistency**: Use the same grid system across all frames to maintain uniformity.
- **Spacing**: Set grid spacing to multiples of 8 (e.g., 8, 16, 24) for a clean and scalable design.
- **Alignment**: Align all elements to the grid to ensure a polished and professional look.

<div style="border: 2px solid rgb(255, 236, 28); padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 4px;">
⚠️ <strong>Tip:</strong> Use Figma’s <strong>Snap to Grid</strong> feature to automatically align elements to the grid.

### Example: Creating a Responsive Grid for Web Design

1. **Select the Frame**:

   - Choose the frame representing your web page.

2. **Add a Column Grid**:

   - Set the **Count** to 12 (a common standard for web design).
   - Define the **Gutter** as 20px and the **Margin** as 24px.

3. **Add a Row Grid**:

   - Set the **Count** to 6 and the **Gutter** to 16px.

4. **Align Elements**:
   - Use the grid to align buttons, text, and images consistently across the design.

## Additional Good Design Practices

- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability by using tools like **[Figma’s contrast checker](https://www.figma.com/color-contrast-checker/)**.
- Use descriptive naming for layers and frames to improve accessibility.
- Support keyboard navigation and consider screen reader compatibility.
