Figma Documentation Project

Team members: Robyn Downie & Shabnam Beiraghian

For assignment 2 in our COMM 2116 course, we were asked to create comprehensive instructions on how to create and share interactive design prototypes using Figma. This documentation focuses on industry best practices and has been optimized for online readability.

The documents were created using Markdown, with CSS applied for styling and Streamable used to embed video files. The project was hosted on Github, which was also used to manage team contributions via version control.

To produce this documentation, we first researched common pain points when using Figma for displaying designs. We then analyzed work flows to identify solutions to those frustrations, and created correctly formatted documentation that was visually appealing and easy to navigate. Finally, we conducted user testing to ensure that the instructions were intuative, and that they addressed real-world design challenges.

Throughout development, we applied the principles of the 7 C's of communication (Clear, Concise, Concrete, Correct, Coherent, Complete, and Courteous), along with consideration of UI/UX best practices to maximize usability.

We hope that our final product demonstrates our understanding of creating effective technical documentation and that you find it helpful for your Figma prototyping needs.
